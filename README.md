# Developing Microservices with AWS

## Creation of Lambda Function 'Book Hotel' via AWS Console

A lambda function has been created with the AWS Management Console.
A simple Node JS handler and related node_modules have been packaged in a .zip file a uploaded to the lambda.

## Creation of Lambda Function 'Book Museum' via AWS CLI

To create a Lambda Function via CLI, the following steps have been followed.

- A JSON document (_trust_policy.json_) outlining the trust policy for the new lambda has been created.
- A custom 'museum-role' execution role has been created with the following command:

```shell
aws iam create-role --role-name my-role --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
```

- The managed _AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole_ AWS policy has been attached to the new role with:

```shell
aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole --role-name museum-role
```

- A deployment package (_deployment.zip_) is created to be deployed to for the lambda function creation.
- A new lambda function is created with the previously created deployment package and execution role with the following command.

```shell
aws lambda create-function --function-name BookMuseum --handler index.handler --memory-size 128 --runtime nodejs18.x --role arn:aws:iam::237291935917:role/museum-role --timeout 3 --zip-file fileb://deployment.zip --publish

```
